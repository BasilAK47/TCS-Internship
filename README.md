Medical datasets, especially medical images, are often imbalanced due to the different incidences of various diseases. To address this problem, many methods have been proposed to synthesize medical images using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to enlarge training datasets for facilitating medical image analysis. For instance, conventional methods such as image-to-image translation techniques are used to synthesize fundus images with their respective vessel trees in the field of fundus image. We propose a  multiple-channels-multiple-landmarks (MCML), aiming to synthesize color fundus images from a combination of vessel tree, optic disc, and optic cup images. 
We will be training the model in google colab. We are using pix2pix model in the project. Fused images will be used for prediction. Images will be fused using multi-channel fusion using opencv. SSIM and PSNR will be used as evaluation measure (These measures are used to compare Original image and generated image).
